This is the Image Collation Bot for Discord. This is a "self bot", meaning it runs on your own account, which is against Discord TOS. If you get reported for using it, your account will be banned. However, if you set this bot to only post to a channel on your own private server, no one will ever know.

What this bot does is collect images from a set of registered channels and repost them to a channel of your choosing. This is useful if you are using several discord servers only as image feeds, and don't want all of them collected in one place.

This bot runs on python 3, and has requirements which can be installed via pip, so you'll need to install those.

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the bot from the command line. Type "!icb_help" in any discord channel (preferably one on your private server) for a list of commands.

DO NOT MAKE A CHANNEL BOTH AN INPUT AND AN OUTPUT. This will do exactly what you think it will do.
